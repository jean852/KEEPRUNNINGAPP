With KeepRunning, you can track your running activities on Strava and set challenges for yourself to push your limits. But here's the best part: you can lock money in a pool to give yourself even more motivation to succeed. If you meet your challenge, you'll get your money back plus a sense of accomplishment. If you don't, you'll have to part with the cash. This added layer of accountability will help you stay on track and crush your goals. So why wait? Download KeepRunning today and start your journey to becoming a better runner!</p>

<h4>Tech used to develop Keep Running</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Omniauth and Strava API to allow users to connect their Strava accounts</li>
  <li>Stimulus for Javascript functionality (e.g. FlatpickrController)</li>
  <li>Pundit for User Authorisation</li>
  <li>Sidekiq to refresh User authentication tokens</li>
  <li>Postgres for our DB</li>
</ul>
 
<br>

<h4>Difficulties faced</h4>
<ul>
  <li>As this was a two week bootcamp project, we only had time to make a mobile-responsive site. We will be upgrading the responisiveness over the coming months</li>
  <li>Several issues with Sidekiq and refreshing User tokens. We look to improve our user functionality so there there are no issues after the 6 hour token refresh period</li>
  <li>Creating refund logic through the Stripe API. We aim to have this fixed in the next month.</li>
  </ul>
